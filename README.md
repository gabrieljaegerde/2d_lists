## Grading

Your assignment will be graded automatically every time you push. Check the GitHub Actions tab to see the results.

## Exercises

1. **Merge and Sort Lists**: Implement a function `merge_and_sort_lists` that takes two lists as arguments, merges them into one list, and then sorts the merged list in ascending order.
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Implement a function `remove_duplicates` that removes all duplicate values in a list and returns a list with only the unique elements in the order they appeared.
3. **Count Occurrences**: Implement a function `count_occurrences` that counts how many times each element appears in a list and returns a dictionary with the elements of the list as keys and their counts as values.
4. **Is Sublist**: Implement a function `is_sublist` that checks whether a list is a sublist of another list.
5. **Rotate List**: Implement a function `rotate_list` that rotates the elements of a list to the right by `k` places where `k` is non-negative.
6. **Generate Numbers**: Implement a function `generate_numbers` that returns a list of numbers from 1 to n.
7. **Generate Squares**: Implement a function `generate_squares` that returns a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to n and values are their squares.
8. **Get Row and Column Count**: Implement two functions `get_row_count` and `get_column_count` that return the number of rows and the number of columns in a two-dimensional list, respectively.
9. **Get Element**: Implement a function `get_element` that retrieves the element at the specified row and column in a two-dimensional list.
10. **Sum of Two-D List**: Implement a function `sum_two_d_list` that computes the sum of all numbers in a two-dimensional list.
11. **Print Rows**: Implement a function `print_rows` that prints each row of a two-dimensional list on a new line.
12. **Contains Value**: Implement a function `contains_value` that checks if a given value is present in any of the sublists of a two-dimensional list.
13. **Append to Sublists**: Implement a function `append_to_sublists` that appends a new value at the end of every sublist within a two-dimensional list.
14. **Replace in Two-D List**: Implement a function `replace_in_two_d_list` that replaces all instances of an old value with a new value in a two-dimensional list.
15. **First Elements**: Implement a function `first_elements` that returns a new list containing the first elements from each sublist in a two-dimensional list.
16. **Even Elements Sublists**: Implement a function `even_elements_sublists` that returns a list of lists, with each inner list containing the even-indexed elements of the original sublists.
17. **Concatenate Sublists**: Implement a function `concatenate_sublists` that concatenates all sublists in a two-dimensional list into a single list.

Good luck and happy coding!
